# Encoded Semi-TeleGram (ESTG)

## Overview
ESTG encodes information in a symbolic semi-telegraphic form. Each ESTG code consists of words, numbers, and a defined symbol set. A message may map to multiple ESTG expressions; ambiguity is intrinsic. Example:  ** → “Revenue growth is approximately 10% heading into 2028.”

## Symbol Set

| Symbol | Function | Interpretation |
|:--------|:-----------|:----------------|
| `.` | Terminator | End of statement |
| `,` | Separator | Pause, clause division |
| `&` | Conjunction | “and” |
| `:` | Link | Label, description |
| `?` | Conditional / Uncertainty | “if”, “whether”, “maybe” |
| `~` | Approximation | “around”, “fuzzy range” |
| `%` | Probability / Fraction | Percent or ratio |
| `[]` | Group / List | Enclosed items |
| `>` | Direction / Causality / Comparison | “toward”, “causes”, “greater than” |
| `<` | Reverse Direction / Causality / Comparison | “from”, “caused by”, “less than” |
| `!` | Assertion / Exception / Warning | Strong emphasis or anomaly |

## Extended Usage: Embedded Code Snippets

ESTG codes can embed executable or pseudo-executable fragments from programming languages such as Python, Rust, or domain-specific syntaxes. Embedded code follows the same semi-telegraphic principles: minimalism, directionality, and compact causality. All embedded segments use the standardized form <code>[lang]{ ... }</code>, where <em>lang</em> is the language identifier (e.g., <code>python</code>, <code>rust</code>, <code>protoX</code>), and the inner braces contain native code without alteration.
